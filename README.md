Data analysis of 2020 - 2021 Covid Vaccination and Deaths:
In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data from 01-01-2020 to 04-30-2021 using datasets from Our World In Data: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The goal was to look at COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations to answer key questions about the global impact of the pandemic. I explored how many total cases and deaths each country reported, examined daily new cases in the United States over time, and compared countries to see which had higher death rates relative to total cases. I also looked at the relationship between vaccinations and total cases to see if higher vaccination numbers were linked to fewer infections. Additionally, I compared daily new cases among the United States, India, and Brazil, and to account for population differences, I analyzed deaths per million people to provide a fairer comparison across countries of different sizes.
